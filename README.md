Network Data Analysis With Artificial Intelligence


This project is developed using the Naive Bayes algorithm to analyze various attacks and normal network flow in network traffic with artificial intelligence. 

The F1 score is 0.998. The confusion matrix is as follows. 


This dataset is preprocessed according to the network based intrusion detection system in Iot devices.
0- normal
1- wrong setup
2- ddos
3- Data type probing (ultrasonic sensor was used so in data type probing mostly string values are sent to the server)
4 - scan attack
5 - man in the middle
